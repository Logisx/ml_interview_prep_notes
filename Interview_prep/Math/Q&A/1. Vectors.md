Also, in 2d case dot product can be represented as linear transformation fro![Pasted image 202503051![Pasted image 20250305144341.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305144341.png)03051![Pasted image 20250305144044.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305144044.png)02503051![Pasted image 20250305144447.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305144447.png)ize the dot product the length of projection of v on u should be max and they should be in the same direction, this happens when v aligns with u. The v is unit vector, so ||v|| = 1. To get the v we can divide u by ||u|| as it will give length of 1 and the same d![Pasted image 202503051![Pasted image 20250305144910.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305144910.png)202503051![Pasted image 20250305145152.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305145152.png)oduct = cross product.
Geometric interpretation is that cross prod is a vector with length of the area of parallelogram formed by the vectors and the direction perpendicular to parallelogram.
To compute the are we need to take determinant of matrix made by those vectors.

If 2 vectors are linearly independent you can get to any point in the plane by scaling and adding those vectors.
Vectors are linearly Dependent if one can be represented as scalar multiplication of an![Pasted image 202503051![Pasted image 20250305164131.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305164131.png)are in the same basis they could be both represented by the basis vectors. The linear combination of the basis vectors should be sufficient to obtain both A![Pasted image 202503051![Pasted image 20250305164249.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305164249.png) of a set of vectors is the subspace formed by all possible linear combinations of those vectors.
The dimension of this subspace is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in t![Pasted image 202503051![Pasted image 20250305164446.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305164446.png)2503051![Pasted image 20250305164857.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250305164857.png)size of a vector.
Vector is set of numbers.

A:
The term _‚Äú_**_norm_**_‚Äù_ in mathematics comes from the concept of _‚Äúnormal‚Äù_ or ‚Äústandard‚Äù way of measuring the size or length of objects in a vector space. Conceptually, a norm provides a way to quantify the _‚Äúmagnitude‚Äù_ or _‚Äúlength‚Äù_ of a vector, giving a consistent measure of its size. This is analogous to the way we measure the length of a physical object using a ruler.
- **L0 norm**: ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÄ = **3** (since there are three non-zero elements: 3, -4, and 5)
- **L1 norm**: ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÅ = |3| + |-4| + |0| + |5| = 3 + 4 + 0 + 5 = **12**
- **L2 norm**: ‚Äñx‚Äñ‚ÇÇ = ‚àö(3¬≤ + (-4)¬≤ + 0¬≤ + 5¬≤) = ‚àö(9 + 16 + 0 + 25) = ‚àö(50) ‚âà **7.07**
