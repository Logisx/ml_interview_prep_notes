T:
Dot Product is projecting a Vector onto other vector and Multiplying their Length , if the projection is in other direction the Dot Product will be Negative , and if Perpendicular then the projection will be zero

Also, in 2d case dot product can be represented as linear transformation from 2d to 1d.

A: To maximize the dot product the length of projection of v on u should be max and they should be in the same direction, this happens when v aligns with u. The v is unit vector, so ||v|| = 1. To get the v we can divide u by ||u|| as it will give length of 1 and the same direction.

T: Outer product = cross product.
Geometric interpretation is that cross prod is a vector with length of the area of parallelogram formed by the vectors and the direction perpendicular to parallelogram.
To compute the are we need to take determinant of matrix made by those vectors.

A: Transpose means the rows become columns and columns become rows, so vector a becomes row vector.

A: 
Two vectors are **linearly independent** if no scalar multiple of one vector can produce the other.
If 2 vectors are linearly independent you can get to any point in the plane by scaling and adding those vectors.
Vectors are linearly Dependent if one can be represented as scalar multiplication of another

A: If they are in the same basis they could be both represented by the basis vectors. The linear combination of the basis vectors should be sufficient to obtain both A & B.

T: The span of a set of vectors is the subspace formed by all possible linear combinations of those vectors.
The dimension of this subspace is equal to the number of linearly independent vectors in the set.

T:
Norm is size of a vector.
Vector is set of numbers.

A:
The term _“_**_norm_**_”_ in mathematics comes from the concept of _“normal”_ or “standard” way of measuring the size or length of objects in a vector space. Conceptually, a norm provides a way to quantify the _“magnitude”_ or _“length”_ of a vector, giving a consistent measure of its size. This is analogous to the way we measure the length of a physical object using a ruler.
- **L0 norm**: ‖x‖₀ = **3** (since there are three non-zero elements: 3, -4, and 5)
- **L1 norm**: ‖x‖₁ = |3| + |-4| + |0| + |5| = 3 + 4 + 0 + 5 = **12**
- **L2 norm**: ‖x‖₂ = √(3² + (-4)² + 0² + 5²) = √(9 + 16 + 0 + 25) = √(50) ≈ **7.07**
