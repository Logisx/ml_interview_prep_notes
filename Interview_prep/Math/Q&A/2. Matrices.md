A matrix A acts as a function that transforms vectors while preserving the structure of vector spaces (i.e., preserving vector addition and scalar multiplication). This is exactly what **linear** transformations do.

So, basically if you multiply your vector by an inverse it reverts previous linear transformation to the original state of the vector.

### **Summary**

1. The inverse of a matrix AAA is A−1A^{-1}A−1, satisfying AA−1=IA A^{-1} = IAA−1=I.
2. A matrix is invertible **if and only if** it is square and has a nonzero determinant.
3. If a matrix has an inverse, it is **unique**.

The determinant represents by how much the area of some region in space changed after the linear transfromation. Also, if det < 0 it means that the orientation was flipped (like flipping the paper sheet in 2d example).

It also gets multiplied by the scalar.

The trace is the sum of the eignevalues: 3 + 3 + 2 − 1 = 7. 
The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues: 3 · 3 · 2 · (−1) = −18.

2 column vectors are linearly dependent (1st, 3rd col) as one can be represented by scaling of another (1st * (-2) = 3rd). Which means that the determinant is 0.

Covariance is **a measure of the relationship between two random variables**.
Correlation is covariance divided by the product of the two variables standard deviation. So they measure the same thing but one belongs to [-1,1] and the other (covariance) take any value.

If A is square and has full rank, then: x = A−1 b
For **unique solutions**, AAA should be **invertible** (if square) or have full rank (if rectangular) and the system must be **consistent**.
Treat it like a system of equasions:
Each unknown can be seen as an available degree of freedom. Each equation introduced into the system can be viewed as a constraint that restricts one degree of freedom. Therefore, the critical case occurs when the number of equations and the number of free variables are equal – for every variable giving a degree of freedom, there exists a corresponding constraint removing a degree of freedom. The underdetermined case, by contrast, occurs when the system has been underconstrained – that is, when the unknowns outnumber the equations.

Geometrically, the derivative at a given point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent to a curve at a given point is **a straight line which “just touches” the curve at that point**.
Intuitively, the derivative is measure of how fast the function changes in this neighborhood of points.
The derivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change in the function output with respect to a change in the input.
