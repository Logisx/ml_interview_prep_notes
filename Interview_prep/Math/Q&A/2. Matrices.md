1. The inverse of a matrix AAA is A−1A^{-1}A−1, satisfying AA−1=IA A^{-1} = IAA−1=I.
2. A matrix is invertible **if and only if** it is square and has a nonzero determinant.
3. If a matrix has an inverse, it is **uniq![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307144129.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307144129.png)nant represents by how much the area of some region in space changed after the linear transfromation. Also, if det < 0 it means that the orientation was flipped (like flipping the paper sheet in 2d exa![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307144346.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307144346.png)s multiplied by the sc![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307144805.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307144805.png)s the sum of the eignevalues: 3 + 3 + 2 − 1 = 7. 
The determinant is the product of the eigenvalues: 3 · 3 · 2 · (−1) =![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307144921.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307144921.png)ctors are linearly dependent (1st, 3rd col) as one can be represented by scaling of another (1st * (-2) = 3rd). Which means that the determinant ![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307145103.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307145103.png)is **a measure of the relationship between two random variables**.
Correlation is covariance divided by the product of the two variables standard deviation. So they measure the same thing but one belongs to [-1,1] and the other (covariance) take![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307145651.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307145651.png)1![Pasted image 20250307151132.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307151132.png)2503071![Pasted image 20250307153002.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307153002.png)uare and has full rank, then: x = A−1 b
For **unique solutions**, AAA should be **invertible** (if square) or have full rank (if rectangular) and the system must be **consistent**.
Treat it like a system of equasions:
Each unknown can be seen as an available degree of freedom. Each equation introduced into the system can be viewed as a constraint that restricts one degree of freedom. Therefore, the critical case occurs when the number of equations and the number of free variables are equal – for every variable giving a degree of freedom, there exists a corresponding constraint removing a degree of freedom. The underdetermined case, by contrast, occurs when the system has been underconstrained – that is, when the unknowns outnumber the equat![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307153651.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307153651.png)ly, the derivative at a given point is the slope of the tangent line to the graph of the function at that point. The tangent to a curve at a given point is **a straight line which “just touches” the curve at that point**.
Intuitively, the derivative is measure of how fast the function changes in this neighborhood of points.
The derivative of a function measures the sensitivity to change in the function output with respect to a change in![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307155037.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307155037.png)[Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307155532.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307155532.png)![Pasted image 202503071![Pasted image 20250307155652.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/Math/Q&A/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250307155652.png)
