**Covariance**
- Measures how two variables change together.
- If both increase or decrease together, covariance is **positive**; if one increases while the other decreases, it is **negative**.
- However, it is **not standardized**, meaning its value depends on the scale of the variables.

**Correlation** is covariance scaled form -1 to 1.

**Causation** means one variable directly influences the other. Correlation **does not imply causation**.
