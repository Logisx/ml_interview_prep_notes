TF-IDF is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document within a collection or corpus of documents. It combines two key factors: Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF).

TF-IDF is widely used in:

1. **Information Retrieval:** Search engines use TF-IDF to rank documents based on relevance to user queries[2](https://studyopedia.com/natural-language-processing/nlp-applications-of-tfidf/)[6](https://myscale.com/blog/master-tf-idf-basics-in-machine-learning/).
    
2. **Text Classification:** Helps categorize text (e.g., spam detection, sentiment analysis)[2](https://studyopedia.com/natural-language-processing/nlp-applications-of-tfidf/).
    
3. **Keyword Extraction:** Identifies important words in documents for summarization[10](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-tfidf).
    
4. **Similarity Analysis:** Compares documents using cosine similarity of their TF-IDF vectors[1](https://www.capitalone.com/tech/machine-learning/understanding-tf-idf/).

![](../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250401164411.png)TF-IDF has found applications in various fields, particularly in natural language processing and information retrieval:

1. Information Retrieval: TF-IDF is commonly used in search engines to rank documents based on their relevance to a given query. Documents with higher TF-IDF scores for the query terms are considered more relevant and are ranked higher in search results.

2. Text Classification: In text classification tasks, TF-IDF is used to represent documents as numerical vectors, which can be fed into machine learning algorithms for classification tasks like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, spam detection, etc.

3. Text Summarization: TF-IDF is utilized in text summarization algorithms to identify the most important sentences or phrases in a document, helping to create a concise summary.

4. Keyword Extraction: TF-IDF aids in extracting essential keywords or phrases from a document, which can be valuable for tagging, indexing, or content categorization.

5. Information Extraction: In information extraction tasks, TF-IDF can be used to identify and extract entities, relationships, and relevant information from unstructured text data.
