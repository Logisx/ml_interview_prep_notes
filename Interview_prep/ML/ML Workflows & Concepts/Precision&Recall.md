When you think precision, think fishing rod. It only has one tiny precise little hook, but if that hook catches anything it is almost certainly a fish.

When you think recall, think trawler net. It is big and wide and it drags (‘recalls’) everything back to the boat. You’ll get lots of fish, but lots of other crap as well.
