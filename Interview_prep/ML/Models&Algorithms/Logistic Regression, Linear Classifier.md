Logistic regression is a type of linear classifier that uses the sigmoid function to model probabilities for classification, while linear classifiers can be broader in their approach, not necessarily using sigmoid functions but still relying on a linear decision boundary.
# Linear Classifier
y = Wx+b means that for classification we draw kinda lines and rotates them with W and move them around with b to separate the categories.
