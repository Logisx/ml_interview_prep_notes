Most kernel functions, like the radial basis function (RBF), measure distances (e.g., Euclidean distance) or angles (e.g., cosine similarity) between points in the feature space.

If the features have very different scales (e.g., one feature ranges from 0 to 1 and another ranges from 1,000 to 1,000,000), the kernel might give more weight to features with larger ranges, leading to biased results. Feature scaling (such as normalization or standardization) ensures that all features contribute equally to the kernel computation, improving model performance and stability.

It excels in scenarios where relationships between features are complex and non-linear, and it's well-suited for imbalanced datasets. It is also known for handling missing data well. **Gradient boosting** models, such as **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**, are generally considered **less interpretable** than simpler models like linear regression or decision trees due to their comple![Pasted image 202503131![Pasted image 20250313133043.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/e3d6d81a3c1db81e36c4b60f2a7808c0.png)e linearly separable if there exists at least one hyperplane that splits the space in such a way that all of the points of the first set lie on one one side of the hyperplane, and all of the points of the second set lie on the other side. In the linearly separable case, SVM is trying to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin, with the condition that both classes are classified correctly. But in reality, datasets are almost never linearly separable, so the condition of 100% correctly classified by a hyperplane will ne![Pasted image 202503131![Pasted image 20250313133233.png](ml_interview_prep_notes/Interview_prep/ML/Q&A/attachments/269f857ce6f54352342890385b65b527.png)1![Pasted image 20250313133238.png](../../../../Q&A/attachments/6eca4a124dd26d0b5a8df392bbc6ca44.png)l would vanilla SVM work on this dataset (see Figure 18)? Answer: SVM wonâ€™t work at all, since the two classes are not linearly separable. As discussed above, two potential solutions are: introducing slack variables; using non-linear kernels.
